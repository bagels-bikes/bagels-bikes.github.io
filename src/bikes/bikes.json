An analogous question can be asked about whether two rings have equivalent derived categories. In this talk, we answer this question by going through Jeremy Rickard's paper ‘Morita Theory for Derived Categories,’ where we are introduced to the notion of a Tilting module which generalizes the finitely generated projective generators in classical Morita Theory. We also talk about ‘Morita invariants’ for the derived category.",

On the other hand, certain ideal closures, such as integral closure and tight closure, have seen a lot of interest in defining singularities. These multiplicities and closures are related in the following sense: for nice enough local rings, two ideals have the same Hilbert-Samuel (resp. Hilbert-Kunz) multiplicity if and only if they have the same integral (resp. tight) closure. All these notions can be defined in characteristic p, with tight closure contained in integral closure and Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity smaller than Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity. In this talk, we explore Taylor's theory of s-multiplicities and s-closures, which provide a way to continuously interpolate between the two closures and the two multiplicities. We will see that this theory gives rise to certain distinct multiplicities and closures. Finally, we state certain results and conjectures regarding these interpolations, such as a version of the Briancon-Skoda Theorem.",

This is an extension of a result of Hochster-Huneke that proves the result for regular rings. This result has some consequences that help us understand the absolute integral closure better. Of note is the implication that R^+ is a big Cohen-Macaulay algebra for R. If time permits, we can also reformulate this in terms of dualizing complexes.",

In the first talk, we review some preliminary material about local cohomology and Cohen-Macaulay rings and understand the precise statement of the main theorem. As quick applications, we will see how this theorem can be used to prove some well-known results - for example the Hochster-Roberts theorem and the Cohen-Macaulayness of splinters.

We first go back to Matlis Duality and provide the framework for how the Matlis Dual is a D module for non-finitely generated R-modules that are also D-modules. Then we'll give examples of D-modules and their Matlis duals that arise naturally. Lastly, we go over the ingredients for the De Rham duality statement, such as why holonomic modules appear.

Further, if M is a holonomic D-module, then the de Rham cohomology spaces of the Matlis dual of M are k-dual to those of M.

If the generators for I form a regular sequence, the Koszul complex is also a free resolution for R/I. But if they don't form a regular sequence, Tate provided a general construction in 1957 that always produces a DG R-algebra that is also a free resolution for R/I. In this talk, we define free resolutions, the Koszul complex, and DG algebras. We then describe Tate's construction. Finally, we state a nice result from Tate's paper about certain rings for which this construction terminates after only 2 steps. In general, Tate's construction may take infinitely many steps. If time allows, I'll discuss an outline of a proof of this theorem in a special case.",

Each of these is a subgroup G of GL_t and acts naturally on a ring like R = K[Y_{t x n}] via matrix multiplication, and the ring of invariants R^G is what shall be looking at. In characteristic zero, the inclusion R^G  ↪ R possesses an appropriate splitting, and we shall describe methods of computing this over an arbitrary field of characteristic zero. Lastly, we will contrast this with positive characteristic and note a curious phenomenon that every characteristic zero splitting must have every prime appearing in the denominator. ",
