We first go back to Matlis Duality and provide the framework for how the Matlis Dual is a D module for non-finitely generated R-modules that are also D-modules. Then we'll give examples of D-modules and their Matlis duals that arise naturally. Lastly, we go over the ingredients for the De Rham duality statement, such as why holonomic modules appear. But most importantly, we celebrate two birthdays!",

Further, if M is a holonomic D-module, then the de Rham cohomology spaces of the Matlis dual of M are k-dual to those of M. In this talk, I will present the first result, and some basic definitions and results about holonomic D-modules.",

We're going to reinterpret a Koszul complex for the graded polynomial ring/symmetric algebra as a duality with the exterior algebra. More generally, we will define this Koszul complex for \"quadratic algebras\", and when it happens to be exact, we will get Koszul duality, which relates to certain Ext algebras.",

If the generators for I form a regular sequence, the Koszul complex is also a free resolution for R/I. But if they don't form a regular sequence, Tate provided a general construction in 1957 that always produces a DG R-algebra that is also a free resolution for R/I. In this talk, we define free resolutions, the Koszul complex, and DG algebras. We then describe Tate's construction. Finally, we state a nice result from Tate's paper about certain rings for which this construction terminates after only 2 steps. In general, Tate's construction may take infinitely many steps. If time allows, I'll discuss an outline of a proof of this theorem in a special case.",

Each of these is a subgroup G of GL_t and acts naturally on a ring like R = K[Y_{t x n}] via matrix multiplication, and the ring of invariants R^G is what shall be looking at. In characteristic zero, the inclusion R^G  ↪ R possesses an appropriate splitting, and we shall describe methods of computing this over an arbitrary field of characteristic zero. Lastly, we will contrast this with positive characteristic and note a curious phenomenon that every characteristic zero splitting must have every prime appearing in the denominator. ",
