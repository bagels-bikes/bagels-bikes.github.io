The CM (Chow-Mumford) line bundle is a naturally defined (Q-)line bundle on the base of families of Fano varieties. This then defines an ample line bundle on the moduli space of K-polystable varieties, making this moduli space a projective variety. The weighted CM line bundle is an extension of this to a \"weighted\" version of K-stability, where the weight  is simply a positive continuous function on a certain polytope. To make this construction precise, we will use the Stone-Weierstrass theorem.",

In particular, we will find a full strong exceptional collection (essentially an orthorgonal basis) for D^b(P^n), and we will use this to get a derived equivalence to bound quiver representations.",

If time permits, I will discuss the MMP in the context of quasi-log schemes.",

Affine toric varieties can be described combinatorially in terms of polyhedral cones and fans. In this talk, we will explore the link between certain continued fraction expansions and resolutions of singularities of toric surfaces. In particular, we will see that for toric surfaces obtained from cones in certain forms, that computing a continued fraction expansion results in a series of blowups on the toric surface that constitute a resolution of singularities. We focus on explicit computations.",

A common strategy showing a variety is not rational is naturally to show one of its birational invariants differ from that of projective space. In this talk, I will focus on a theorem of Iskovskikh and Manin which disproves rationality of smooth quartic threefolds in P4. I will start with its inspiration, a proof of Noether's theorem on the structure of the Cremona group of P2, discuss a low dimensional case which is similar in spirit to the case of quartic threefolds, and mention how these ideas generalize to higher dimensions using singularities.

Lusztig and Vogan independently conjectured the existence of a certain bijection between representations of a maximal compact subgroup and certain geometric data. The first proof was done for complex groups by Bezrukavnikov using an idea of Deligne. We will go over the structure theory of the nilpotent cone and how Bezrukavnikov proved his result. Time permitting we will talk about generalizations of his result and techniques being used to compute this abstract bijection.",

We will discuss the history of this geometric advancement and see how one uses them to study representations. ",
